As you can see from this Gannt graph, I have planned ahead in hope time management, and have gave myself time for each section to which I believe it would take, for example I have gave myself two hours to complete my evaluation whilst I gave myself one hour to complete both question 5 and 6.

###Question Research:

When I started my research, I looked at the question I was going to complete and from my original analysis I concluded that I was going to need to need to research:

> - Canvases
> - Image Sprites
> - Event functions (when IMAGESPRITE.TOUCHED and when NOTIFIER.AFTERCHOOSING)
> - How to use arrays effectively

Initially, I went to YouTube where I watched a video on how to use text to speech functions, which gave me a thorough understanding of how to successfully utilise event functions as I needed to make the text to speech only speak after pressing a button, which taught me how to use event functions. After this I started attempting to discover how to successfully use Arrays and Lists.  I started this off by defining a basic global array which contained 10 variables, and made it so when you touched the screen, it will slowly send alerts to the user with the 10 variables one by one, by indexing the array and printing the integer at that point in the indexed array. 

After this, I attempted to create a two dimensional as in my eyes, I could save the main base array as the part of the array that would store the computers so computers[1] would be the first computer block, and from there I could index either [1] for the x components of the computer room position, [2] for the y component of the computer room position or [3] for the amount of computers in the room, so depending on what I wanted I could index the computer. So for example if I wanted the X component of the 4th computer room I could index computers [4][1] which would return what I wanted, however after creating the array using the tedious method of the blocks, I came to the unfortunate conclusion that either the App Inventor software cannot handle 2D arrays or that I was trying to implement it in a poor fashion.

##Questions:

###Question 1:

To start off with question one, I knew that my goal was to get a picture of a campus, label 10 buildings where computers could be and then set it up with App Inventor to display the map onto the device I was using. I started off by getting the picture of a campus given to me in the A452 pdf document and saving it and opening it up in Photoshop, after this I created 10 text labels and labelled each building in numerical order to create the first half of the task.
After this, I created a new project on App Inventor, separate from the one I used for my research and initial tests, and created a canvas item and parented it to Screen1, from there I changed the Canvas to fill the parent in both the X and Y dimensions. After this, I changed the Background Image to the Map Image thereby completing the task.

To test that his question had been successfully completed I ran the emulator and checked if the campus was visible, here is what my emulator looks like after this task:



Here is a screenshot to conclude that this stage had been successfully completed.
